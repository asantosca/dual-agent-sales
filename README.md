# dual-agent-sales
This project simulates a sales call between an AI sales agent (**Sara**) and a customer (**John**) who abandoned a shirt in their shopping cart. The AI interacts with the customer to complete the purchase, and a **supervisor agent** evaluates the conversation at the end to determine the next steps.
